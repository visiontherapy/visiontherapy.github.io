### CP Saccades exercises
Keep your eyes focused on the middle circle. Click the circle, or press the spacebar to display a the target marker/letter. Using your peripheral vision, locate the corresponding marker in one of the outer circles. Try to click the target marker without moving your eyes away from the central circle. A correct click will result in a green flash, and the central circle will advance to the next target marker. The central circle will flash red if the wrong target marker is clicked.

Instead of clicking the targets, you may use other means of identifying the target marker (eg, by placing a stick or physical pointer and verifying the correct target by looking there). In this case, pressing the space bar will advance the central marker to the next target.
