# Vision therapy tools.
This is a work in progress. 

Go to https://visiontherapy.github.io/ to access the tools.

### CP Saccades exercises
Keep your eyes focused on the middle circle. Click the circle, or press the spacebar to display a the target marker/letter. Using your peripheral vision, locate the corresponding marker in one of the outer circles. Try to click the target marker without moving your eyes away from the central circle. A correct click will result in a green flash, and the central circle will advance to the next target marker. The central circle will flash red if the wrong target marker is clicked.

Instead of clicking the targets, you may use other means of identifying the target marker (eg, by placing a stick or physical pointer and verifying the correct target by looking there). In this case, press the space bar to advance the central marker to the next target.

### Hart Charts
- Read each letter at a steady pace.
- Use metronome if needed, to maintain the pace.
  - Built in metronome may stutter occasionally as it is not 100% accurate.

### Letter Tracking
- Target word count of 100
- If all letters are not shown within target word count, keep generating words until all letters are accounted for
- Allowable letter combinations taken from "wordbank".
- If all letters are not present in the wordbank, script will show an error.

TODO:
- put start button in front of first letter.
- Stop clock when last Z is clicked
