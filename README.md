# Vision therapy tools.
This is a work in progress. 

These tools and mini-games are designed for use under guidance from a vision therapist. Some of the tools are modeled after existing games, and can be played as regular games.

Go to https://visiontherapy.github.io/ for more information, and to access the tools.
